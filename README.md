# Building-a-Blockchain

Getting started: A blockchain is a digital ledger of records that’s arranged in chunks of data called blocks. These blocks then link with one another through a cryptographic validation known as a hashing function. Linked together, these blocks form an unbroken chain — a blockchain.
Understanding blockchains is difficult, but you can understand by building it.

Applications or softwares used:
- Jetbrains Pycharm
